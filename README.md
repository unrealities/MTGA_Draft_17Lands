- **Step 6:** Open `Installer.iss` in Inno Setup and click Build->Compile.
  - In the `{app}` folder, rename the mysetup.exe file to `setup.exe` and move the file to the main `MTGA_Draft_17Lands` folder.

## UI Features

- **Current Draft:** Lists the current draft type (i.e., Premier, Quick, or Traditional) that the application has identified.
  - P1P1 doesn't appear for Premier and Traditional drafts until after P1P2 in the Arena logs.
  - You can hide this feature by deselecting `Enable Current Draft Display` in the [Settings window](#settings)
- **Data Source:** Lists the current draft type (i.e., Premier, Quick, or Traditional) from which the application pulls the card data.
  - The application will attempt to pull data for the current draft type and set (e.g., data from NEO_PremierDraft_Data.json for a Premier Draft). If the user hasn't downloaded the data file for the current draft type and set, then the application will attempt to use a different data file from the same set (e.g., NEO_QuickDraft_Data.json if NEO_PremierDraft_Data.json isn't available).
  - This field will display "None" if the application cannot find a valid data file for the current draft type and set.
  - You can hide this feature by deselecting `Enable Data Source Options` in the [Settings window](#settings)
  - You can select a given user group. 17lands provides data from "Top," "Bottom," and "Middle" users. This data needs to be fetched when you add set data; the default option remains "All" [Definitions of user groups](https://www.17lands.com/metrics_definitions).
- **Deck Filter:** A drop-down that lists all available deck color permutations that you can use to filter the deck card ratings.
  - The percentage next to the number represents the win rate for that color combination. These percentage values are collected from the [color rating page on 17Lands](https://www.17lands.com/color_ratings). If there were no values, the sample size was too small to determine the win rate (unpopular deck combination).
  - The `All Decks` option lists the combined rating across all of the deck color combinations
    - The `Auto` option will keep the filter at `All Decks` for the first 15 picks and then switch over to the filter that best matches your taken cards. See the Auto Highest Rating note in the Card Logic section.
  - You can hide this feature by deselecting `Enable Deck Filter Options` in the [Settings window](#settings)
- **Refresh Button:** Trigger a log read.
  - Can find cards for P1P1 using [The P1P1 Solution](#the-p1p1-solution)
  - The application will automatically read new log entries, so this button is only required if you use an outdated operating system (Windows 7 or 8).
  - You can hide this feature by deselecting `Enable Refresh Button` in the [Settings window](#settings)
- **Pack / Pick Table:** This table displays the cards included in the current pack.  
  - This table will show a number under the name column if a dataset is missing `Data Source: None` or an unrecognized card is listed.
- **Missing Cards Table:** This table displays the cards missing from an already seen pack.
  - The user's chosen card will have an asterisk next to the name.
  - You can hide this feature by deselecting `Enable Missing Cards` in the [Settings window](#settings)
- **Draft Stats Table:** This table lists the card distribution and total for creatures, non-creatures, and all cards taken during the draft.
  - The numbered columns represent the cost of the card (CMC).
  - You can hide this feature by deselecting `Enable Draft Stats` in the [Settings window](#settings)

## Card Logic

- **Win Rate Grades:** The application calculates the mean and standard deviation for all of the win rate fields (GIHWR, OHWR, GPWR, GDWR, etc.) and assigns a letter grade based on the number of standard deviations from the mean.
- Example: If the mean OHWR for the set is 56.8% and the standard deviation is 4.68, then a card with an OHWR of 62% will have a letter grade of B+ since it's between 1 standard deviation (`56.8 + 1 * 4.68 = 61.48%`) and 1.33 standard deviations (`56.8 + 1.33 * 4.68 = 63.02%`) from the mean (see the table below).

| Letter Grade     | Standard Deviations|
|:----------------:|:------------------:|
| A+               | >= 2.00            |
| A                | >= 1.67            |
| A-               | >= 1.33            |
| B+               | >= 1.00            |
| B                | >= 0.67            |
| B-               | >= 0.33            |
| C+               | >= 0               |
| C                | >= -0.33           |
| C-               | >= -0.67           |
| D+               | >= -1.00           |
| D                | >= -1.33           |
| D-               | >= -1.67           |
| F                | <  -1.67           |

- **Win Rate Ratings:** The application will calculate the mean and standard deviation to identify an upper and lower limit (-1.67 to 2.00 standard deviations from the mean) and perform the following calculation to determine a card's rating: `((card_gihwr - lower_limit) / (upper_limit - lower_limit)) * 5.0`
  - Example: If the calculated mean and standard deviation for a set are 56.8% and 4.68, then the upper limit will be `56.8 + 2.00 * 4.68 = 66.16%`, the lower limit will be `56.8 - 1.67 * 4.68 = 48.98%`, and the resulting rating for a card with a win rate of 62% will be `(((62 - 48.98) / (66.16 - 48.98)) * 5.0 = 3.7)`

- **Bayesian Average:** When this feature is activated, the win rate data is subjected to a Bayesian average calculation that considers specific assumptions (e.g., an anticipated range of 40-60% with a mean of 50%). This Bayesian average considers prior assumptions and observed data, providing a more reliable estimation of the win rate, particularly in small sample sizes (less than 200 samples) or where data availability is limited. A comprehensive explanation can be found [here](https://github.com/unrealities/MTGA_Draft_17Lands/issues/5#issuecomment-1075193138).
  - Enabled: The application will apply this calculation to all win rate data. However, the adjustment made by the calculation will gradually diminish as the sample count, such as the number of games in hand for the Games in Hand Win Rate, reaches 200. As the sample size increases, the Bayesian average will be more influenced by the observed data rather than the prior assumptions, resulting in a more reliable estimation of the win rate.
  - Disabled: The application will not apply this calculation to the win rate data.
  - **As of September 2023, this feature has become obsolete. The 17Lands endpoint no longer provides win rate data for cards with fewer than 500 samples.**

- **Auto Highest Rating:** If the `Auto` filter is set, and the user has taken at least 16 cards, then the application will try and determine the leading color combination from the taken cards. If the tool cannot identify a definitive leading color pair, it will display the highest win rate of the top two color combinations for each win rate field (e.g., GIHWR, OHWR, etc.). The filter label will display both color combinations separated by a slash (e.g., `Auto (WB/UBG)`).
  - Example: If the user has taken primarily black, blue, and green cards, and Generous Visitor has a BG win rate of 66% and a UB rating of 15%, the displayed win rate will be 66%.

- **Deck Suggester:** The deck suggester will create multiple decks (Aggro, Mid, and Control) for each viable color combination using a pool of cards with the highest win rates. It will follow generic deck-building requirements. The suggester will assess and rate each deck, selecting the highest-rated one for each viable color combination. The deck suggester will NOT identify card synergies and build an intentionally synergistic deck.
  - Deck Building Requirements:
    - Aggro Deck:
      - The deck must have a minimum of 9 creatures and should have no less than 17 creatures.
      - The deck should include a minimum of two 1-drops, five 2-drops, and three 3-drops.
      - All creatures' average CMC (Converted Mana Cost) must be 2.40 or less.
      - The deck has 16 lands.
    - Mid Deck:
      - The deck must have a minimum of 9 creatures and should have no less than 15 creatures.
      - The deck should include a minimum of four 2-drops, three 3-drops, two 4-drops, and one 5-drop.
      - The average CMC of all creatures must be 3.04 or less.
      - The deck has 17 lands.
    - Control Deck:
      - The deck must have a minimum of 9 creatures and should have no less than 10 creatures.
      - The deck should include a minimum of three 2-drops, two 3-drops, two 4-drops, and one 5-drop.
      - The average CMC of all creatures must be 3.68 or less.
      - The deck has 18 lands.
  - Notes:
    - The CMC average and land requirements were derived from this [article](https://www.channelfireball.com/article/How-Many-Lands-Do-You-Need-in-Your-Deck-An-Updated-Analysis/cd1c1a24-d439-4a8e-b369-b936edb0b38a/).
    - The deck distribution and CMC requirements may occasionally lead to the inclusion of cards with lower performance or are considered less effective.
      - Example: If the user possesses a pool of white and blue cards and the available 3-drops are Acquisition Octopus (53.7% win rate for WU) and Guardians of Oboro (50.7% win rate for WU), the deck suggester will include both of these cards to meet the 3-drop requirement for each deck archetype.
    - The rating is determined by calculating the combined GIHWR of all the cards and then subtracting penalties for not meeting the deck requirements.
    - The NEO creature sagas count as creatures.

  - **Wheel:** The "WHEEL" option shows the percentage likelihood of a specific card in a pack being available the second time you see the pack (on the wheel).
  - The logic in the code already existed, and I do not know if a bug was found and not implemented or if the creator wanted to improve upon it before releasing it.
  - Only the first six-packs are considered, and cards with an ALSA of <2 are automatically excluded.
  - The math appears to follow what Sierkovitz published in this [article](https://mtgazone.com/how-to-wheel-in-drafts/)

## The P1P1 Solution

### The Problem

MTGA_Draft_17Lands, like many other platforms, relies on MTG Arena's detailed logs to function. Pack and pick data is read from these logs to determine what cards to display 17 Lands data for. However, we understand the frustration that MTG Arena does not show the pack data for the very first pack of drafts, which can be a significant drawback.

### The Solution

**This is a configurable setting. `Enable P1P1 OCR` is enabled by default.**

The following solution is for P1P1. After you have selected a card, only Arena logs are used:

- A screenshot is taken when you press the `Refresh` button. **enable the `Save P1P1 Screenshots` setting to store sent images.**
- The application converts the image to a base64 string.
- The string and a list of possible card names are sent to a Google Cloud Function (GCF).
- The GCF uses Google Vision API for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). This API returns all text detected in the image.
- The Google Vision results are compared to the possible card names sent via [TheFuzz](https://github.com/seatgeek/thefuzz).
- All possible matches are P1P1 cards; no data persists locally or via GCF.

### Future Considerations

- For 30 days in June/July 2024, there were 913 requests, less than 1000 free requests each month for Google Cloud Functions. I will monitor Bloomburrow's release, but the feature is currently in no jeopardy of being removed.

## Troubleshooting

- **Some cards are missing from the Taken Cards window:** Due to Arena creating a new player log after every restart, the application cannot track cards that were picked and seen prior to a restart. However, players in drafting sessions spanning multiple days or sessions can still use this tool to access the current pack data. It should be noted that this application may not have access to information regarding previous packs and picks, resulting in some missing data.
- **The application can't generate set or debug files:** Windows users might need to run the application as an administrator if the application is installed in a directory with restricted write access.
- **My sealed card pool is missing after restarting Arena:** Arena creates a new player log after every restart, so you will need to open up your sealed event session log by clicking `File->Open` and selecting the `DraftLog_<Set>_Sealed` file if you want to see your sealed card pool. Remember that opening a log file will prevent the application from reading the Arena player log. Therefore, you must restart the application if you wish to initiate a new Arena event.
- **The tables are displaying a win rate of 0% or NA:** The application will display a card win rate value of 0% or NA if that win rate field has fewer than 500 samples (e.g., GIHWR will be 0% or NA if the number of games in hand is less than 500). Users should consider using the premier draft dataset or downloading a [tier list](https://github.com/unrealities/MTGA_Draft_17Lands/tree/main/Tools/TierScraper17Lands#tier-list-download-extension) for events that have a low player count.
  - ***As of September 2023, the 17Lands endpoint no longer provides win rate data for cards with fewer than 500 samples.**
- **CTRL+G doesn't do anything:** If you're a Mac user, this shortcut isn't available. You must run the application as an administrator if you're a Windows user.
- **The set download process takes 5+ minutes, and I'm seeing _Collecting 17Lands Data - Request Failed_ multiple times:** If you attempt to download too many sets within a short period, 17Lands will impose rate-limiting on your connection. Therefore, when downloading multiple sets, waiting at least 10 minutes between them is advisable.
- **SSL errors in log on MacOS: `ERROR - limited_sets.retrieve_scryfall_sets - <urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1000)`** Install SSL certificates via /Applications/Python 3.12/Install Certificates.command
