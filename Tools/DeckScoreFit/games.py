"""Read a 17Lands game dump again: the sampled decks' hands, other games' win rates.

    python Tools/DeckScoreFit/games.py --games game_data_public.FRA.PremierDraft.csv.gz \
        --decks decks.json.gz --out games.json.gz

For each game of a deck from decks.py, it keeps whether the player was on the
play, their mulligans, the result and the opening hand. Every deck in the dump
falls in one of FOLDS folds by its ID; for each fold it counts, for each card
and for the deck's main colors and all decks, the games it was in hand
(opening hand or drawn) and won, and the games it was in the deck but not
drawn and won. quality.py rates a deck from the other folds' counts, so no
deck's results are in its own ratings and every set's ratings come from most
of its dump. Standard library only.
