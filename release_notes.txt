* Add Git issues
* Re-Added Wheel Display Option

===================== RELEASE NOTES 3.14 =====================
* Huge Improvements by FiYir && Truth-
* FiYir added support for the new log events from the recent Arena update. My approach to this issue was a bit different from yours, and I decided to try to make the change backward compatible and potentially future-proof. WOTC has reverted changes in the past, so it's possible that they might revert these ones. I verified my changes for premier, quick, and traditional drafts (see tests/test_card_logic.py), but not sealed.
* FiYir fixed the Chrome plugin, which had stopped working a while ago. I also modified the UI change a bit to make it clearer that this is not part of the 17Lands site.
* FiYir fixed some broken application code related to tier comments and split cards.
* FiYir changed the limited_sets code so that when you download a set, you also download the bonus sheet, special guest, list, etc. This was an existing feature in the original project that I believe was used for downloading cube datasets. I just made the change for all of the sets. If you delete your old Temp/temp_set_list file, the app will create a new one with the modified set codes.
* FiYir refactored the code so that the latest versions of PIL and Pydantic are supported.
* FiYir added GitHub workflows for running the pytest test cases whenever a pull request is created. It includes workflows for Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu.
* Truth- addressed an issue with the original tool where it wouldn't download card data if the ALSA or ATA values were null (below the confidence threshold).
* Truth- Replaced the old card compare autocomplete with a custom version. You now use the up and down arrow keys to cycle through matches.
